# Frontend Assignment 2025 - Guide to Hidden Gems

[เวอร์ชันภาษาไทย](./README.md)

In this assignment, you need to create a web application "Guide to Hidden Gems", a collection of restaurants designed to help users easily discover places that fit their needs.

**This assignment must be completed within 7 days from the date you receive the email.**

## Prerequisites

Prepare your development environment with the following checklist

- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Node.js v20 or later (recommended to install via a version manager such as `nvm`)

## Tasks

The "Guide to Hidden Gems" Web Application consists of 3 components

1. Data Server - A data repository for collecting all guide and restaurant data (already prepared for you)
2. API Gateway - An intermediary that aggregates data from services and provides it to the web app
3. Web - A web interface for displaying the UI

For this assignment, you need to develop 2 parts: **the API Gateway** and **the Web Application**.

### 1. API Gateway

`At LINE MAN Wongnai, frontend developers sometimes also create API Gateways in addition to building web apps.`

In this task, you need to create an API Gateway Server that **collects data from the provided data server** (the data server will be discussed in the next section)

**API Gateway can use any language, framework, and tools according to your preference**

#### Requirements

- [ ] Create endpoints that aggregate and return data to the web app, considering various errors that may occur
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure that the API Gateway can work correctly

### 2. Web

`Building web applications is the main responsibility and passion of frontend developers at LINE MAN Wongnai`

In this task, you need to create a React web application to display restaurant guides, making it easy for users to search for restaurants of interest.

![UI design example of the "Guide to Hidden Gems" web](./ui-example.jpg)

> "Going to travel to Kanchanaburi, want to know what restaurants are worth visiting around there"

> "I heard that matcha is currently trending on social media, let me see what matcha shops are worth visiting, preferably specialized shops"

> "Going to treat juniors, which restaurant can accommodate many people"

**The Web Application must be written with React and TypeScript, and you can choose to use other libraries according to your preference**

#### Requirements

Create a web application that connects to the API Gateway to display restaurant guides **considering good UX and UI for users**, making users feel that using our web is more convenient and faster than searching directly from search engines.

In restaurant guides, there are mainly 2 essential features: Guide Detail and Guide Restaurant

**Guide Detail**

- [ ] **Guide title**
- [ ] **Description** - explains what the guide is about and what kinds of restaurants it includes
- [ ] **Tags** - relevant keywords for the guide
- [ ] **Cover image** - cover image for the guide

**Guide Restaurant**

- [ ] Restaurant images
- [ ] Restaurant name
- [ ] Description about this restaurant
- [ ] Restaurant address
- [ ] Contact information
- [ ] Rating / number of stars
- [ ] Restaurant categories

Beyond the above features, you may add any other features that improve UX, accessibility, and usability.

**Coding**

- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the Web application work correctly

## Grading Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on

- [ ] Website can work correctly according to all the mentioned requirements
- [ ] Website has good UX/UI
- [ ] Proficiency in Javascript, Typescript, and React
- [ ] Good Developer experience maintainable, well-structured code
- [ ] Both frontend (website) and backend (server) systems must have good performance and security

The evaluation criteria may be adjusted at the examiner’s discretion.

## Data Server API Specification

The Data Server is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for different functions, such as restaurant data and guide data. These services are accessible via REST API calls.
You can view and test the APIs of each service directly through the Swagger Docs provided when running the Data Server (links will be specified for each service).
